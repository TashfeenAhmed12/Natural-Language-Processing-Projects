# Understanding Car Buying Preferences

# Objective

In this project, we analyzed social media discussions from an ["Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans"](https://forums.edmunds.com/discussion/2864/general/x/entry-level-luxury-performancesedans) forum to offer insights to brand, product, and advertising managers on consumer perceptions. We developed a tool to scrape around 5,000 posts, identifying top brands by mention frequency, and used sentiment analysis to understand brand associations and attributes valued by consumers. Our findings provided strategic advice based on the analysis of brand positions, consumer preferences, and aspirational sentiments, focusing on enhancing brand strengths and addressing weaknesses in product offerings and marketing strategies. This comprehensive analysis helps managers tailor their approaches to align with consumer desires and competitive landscapes.

# Data Collection and Description

We collected data from the "Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans" forum on Edmunds.com, capturing around 5,000 posts. The data, stored in a .csv file, included the date of posting, user ID, and message content

# Methodology
Our methodology combined data scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis to extract and analyze consumer opinions from online forums. Initially, we developed a web crawler to systematically collect posts, which were then processed to identify and count mentions of car brands and attributes. We employed sentiment analysis to gauge the context and positivity of discussions, focusing on posts with positive sentiments to identify aspirational brands. Additionally, we calculated lift ratios to assess brand associations and used multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to visually represent these relationships

# Results and Insights

Our analysis revealed BMW, Acura, Honda, Audi, and Infiniti as the top mentioned brands, highlighting diverse consumer preferences. BMW emerged as the most aspirational brand, highly associated with positive sentiments and desired qualities like performance and luxury. Subaru and Honda were identified for their distinct market positions, with Subaru valued for its niche appeal in safety and outdoor performance, and Honda recognized for its reliability and cost-efficiency. The analysis of car attributes—economy, experience, reputation, performance, and design—showed varying degrees of association with these brands, guiding strategic recommendations for brand positioning and marketing. Insights emphasized the importance of aligning product development and advertising strategies with consumer perceptions and desires
