# Natural-Language-Processing-Projects

In this GitHub repository, I present a collection of NLP (Natural Language Processing) projects I've undertaken. These projects showcase my ability to harness machine learning and computational linguistics to interpret, understand, and generate human language. Each project is a testament to the power of NLP in extracting insights, automating tasks, and solving complex problems in various domains. Through this work, I aim to highlight the significance of NLP technologies in advancing communication, enhancing information retrieval, and driving innovation
