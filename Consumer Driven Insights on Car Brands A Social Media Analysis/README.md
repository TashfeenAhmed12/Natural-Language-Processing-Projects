# Consumer-Driven Insights on Luxury Sedans: A Social Media Analysis

# Objective

This project delves into the discussions within the "Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans" forum to glean insights on consumer opinions about various car brands. By developing a bespoke tool to gather approximately 5,000 forum posts, we aimed to identify the most frequently discussed brands and understand the attributes consumers value. Through sentiment analysis, we assessed the tone and positivity of brand mentions, enabling us to advise brand, product, and advertising managers on optimizing their strategies to meet consumer expectations and enhance brand appeal.

# Data Collection and Description

We embarked on a data collection journey from the "Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans" forum on Edmunds.com, amassing a dataset comprising dates, user IDs, and the content of around 5,000 posts. A pivotal aspect of our data refinement process involved leveraging a "models.csv" dataset, which aligned numerous car models with their corresponding brands. This critical step ensured our analysis remained focused on brands, facilitating a streamlined examination of the discussions

# Methodology
Our analytical strategy was broad and methodical, integrating techniques like data scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis to meticulously analyze and understand the nuances of online discussions about cars. Starting with a custom web crawler, we systematically collected forum posts, which were then processed to accurately identify mentions of car brands and their key attributes. This groundwork allowed us to apply sentiment analysis, focusing on positively framed discussions to uncover aspirational brands. Moreover, we conducted a detailed multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, not only to explore the perceived relationships between different brands but also to examine how specific car attributes—performance, economy, reliability, design, and technology—are associated with these brands. This comprehensive approach enabled us to visualize both brand-brand and brand-attribute associations, offering profound insights into consumer perceptions and preferences, thus informing strategic decision-making for brand positioning and marketing efforts

# Results and Insights

Our investigation unveiled that BMW, Acura, Honda, Audi, and Infiniti were the most discussed brands, each resonating with consumers for distinct reasons. BMW stood out as the aspirational brand par excellence, frequently associated with performance and luxury. The analysis underscored Acura and Honda's unique market positions; Acura received accolades for its fuel efficiency and enjoyable driving dynamics, while Honda was lauded for its brand reputation and value for money. Through multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, we visualized how these brands and the attributes of performance, economy, reliability, design, and technology interrelate, revealing consumers' nuanced perceptions. This analysis highlighted the importance of aligning product features and marketing narratives with these perceptions. For instance, brands closely associated with performance on the MDS plot, like BMW, can leverage this strength in their marketing strategies, while those linked to reliability, like Honda, can emphasize this attribute to attract their target audience
